This project is VERY WIP, don't expect it to run, work, be safe, or be user friendly. 

Don't worry about the following that much.

Default assets can be obtained by calling `get_assets.sh`, this file probably won't work on windows. Files in the assets/game path should be 16x16 pngs and files in the assets/ui path should be 8x16 pngs.
