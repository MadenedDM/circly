This project is VERY WIP, don't expect it to run, work, be safe, or be user friendly (Like me!). 

Don't worry about the following that much.

Default assets can be obtained by calling `get_assets.sh`, this file probably won't work on windows. Files in the assets/game path should be 16x16 pngs and files in the assets/ui path should be 8x16 pngs.

# Design Choices/Goals

1. Planned compatability with Linux and Windows and potential compatability with Mac.
2. Decoupling of Server and Client, or the potential for DIY clients.

# Dream Features
I want to / plan to add these features but my own laziness and stupidity stands in the way:
- Match the contents of [Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial - Written in Python 3 and TCOD](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) except in the crazy design of this
- This list
- The actual game
